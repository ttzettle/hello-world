# hello-world
My first true attempt at Github.

I am Tyler. I am a soon to be graduate of Bloomsburg University's Zeigler College of Business. I am an Information and Technology Management major, but I started as an Accounting major. I was also a Business Education major for a year.

With me nearing graduation, I have been talking around attempting to locate where I would like to start my career. While talking with people, I got the opportunity to talk with my cousin about the path he took and any suggestions he had for me to help jumpstart my career. He suggested I check out Github. With that said, here I am! I am excited to learn more about Github and seeing what exciting new things I can learn!
